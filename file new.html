 pen is the basic need for every employee or any student
we are not the people who can make the pen. I also have been using pens for past 12 years old but i have never wondered about how they have made and who are the
persons that make them. I usually use gel pens but i prefer ball pens. I have to use gel pens because there is a rule in my school that we must use gel blue-inked pens 
in school premises. A ballpoint pen, also known as a biro[3] (British English), ball pen (Bangladeshi, 
 Hong Kong, Indian, Indonesian, Pakistani, Japanese and Philippine English), or dot pen
[4] (Nepali English and South Asian English), is a pen that dispenses ink (usually in paste form)
 over a metal ball at its point, i.e., over a "ball point". 
The metals commonly used are steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.
[5] The design was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative
 to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument;
[6] millions are manufactured and sold daily.
[7] It has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.

Pens are the most used study materials used by any level of students.
We have seen pens many types of pens being used everywhere. But we are till unaware about them.
Pens were invented in 16th century in China. Before that people used feathers of birds as pens. But gradually time passed
and the advancement on everythig grabbed pens as well. Now we can access any types of pens
according to our preference. But ball pens are the most popular pens among them.
<h2>How ball pens are made(steps for making ball pens):</h2>
Basically, Ball pens are made in factories using the below mentioned raw materials:
1. A plastic polymer(Polyproplyene):
Process:

           for making pens,firstly, polyproplyene is melted under high pressure and high temperature. Then, it is transported into an another mold.
           then the plastic polymer is added to that thing and it is poured into a pen shaped iron or steel metal and rest to cool  and be shaped like 
           the metal that we have taken. After that, we should make nib of the pen. And for that,we should use steel wire and make it like as shown
